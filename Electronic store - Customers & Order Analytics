#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6 AND orderID <> 'OrderID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE Product = 'iPhone'
AND length(orderID) = 6 AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT distinct acctnum FROM BIT_DB.customers
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
WHERE length(orderID) = 6 AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT distinct Product, price FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price IN
(SELECT min(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales);

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT distinct Product, sum(Quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6 AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY Product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT distinct Product, sum(Quantity), sum(Quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(distinct customers.acctnum), AVG(Quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT OUTER JOIN BIT_DB.customers ON Feb.orderID = customers.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity > 2
AND length(orderID) = 6 AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT distinct Product, sum(Quantity) FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%' 
GROUP BY Product;

#9. Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive?
SELECT location, count(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE location like '%NY%' GROUP BY location
AND length(orderID) = 6 AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
HAVING count(orderID) > 2;

#10. How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?
SELECT Product, sum(Quantity) as quantity FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE Product like '%headphone%'
GROUP BY Product;

#11. What was the average amount spent per account in February? (average amount spent / number of accounts, not amount spent for each account)
SELECT sum(Quantity*price)/count(customers.acctnum)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers
ON Feb.orderID = customers.order_id
WHERE length(orderID) = 6 AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#12. What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February? (overall average, not average for individual account)
SELECT sum(Quantity)/count(customers.acctnum)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb 
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers
ON Feb.orderID = customers.order_id
WHERE length(orderID) = 6 AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#13. Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?
SELECT Product, sum(quantity*price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY sum(quantity*price) desc
